Data dictionary for measures of access to employment for Canadian Cities (see the accompanying documentation for more information)

Fields:

gid = record id
dauid = dissemination area
cmauid = census metropolitan area
population = population of the dissemination area
area_km2 = area of the dissemination area in km^2
pop_density = population density of the dissemination area in people per km^2
comp_transit = measure of competitive accessibility to jobs by transit from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest)
comp_car = measure of competitive accessibility to jobs by transit from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest)
comp2_transit = measure of competitive accessibility to jobs by transit from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest) where the impedence function is squared
comp2_car = measure of competitive accessibility to jobs by transit from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest) where the impedence function is squared
grav_transit = measure of accessibility to jobs by transit using a gravity function
grav_car = measure of accessibility to jobs by car using a gravity function
T30_transit = number of jobs reachable within a 30 minute transit commute
T45_transit = number of jobs reachable within a 45 minute transit commute
T60_transit = number of jobs reachable within a 60 minute transit commute
T30_car = number of jobs reachable within a 30 minute car commute
T45_car = number of jobs reachable within a 45 minute car commute
T60_car = number of jobs reachable within a 60 minute car commute
comp_ratio = comp_transit / comp_car
comp2_ratio = comp2_transit / comp2_car
grav_ratio = grav_transit / grav_car
T30_ratio = T30_transit / T30_car	
T45_ratio = T45_transit / T45_car	
T60_ratio = T60_transit / T60_car
